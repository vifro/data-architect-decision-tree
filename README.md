# GCP Data Engineering Architect Decision Tree

## 1. Business Objectives & Stakeholder Needs
- **1.1 Use Case Type**
  - **(A) Analytical/BI (Dashboarding, Reporting)**
    - → Proceed to 1.2
  - **(B) Product/Feature (Real-Time, Personalization)**
    - → Likely need streaming + real-time analytics (e.g., Pub/Sub + Dataflow)
    - → Skip most pure BI steps; jump to **Section 4 (Security & Compliance)** and incorporate real-time design
- **1.2 Dashboard/Refresh Frequency**
  - **(A) Near Real-Time (sub-second to minute-level latency)**
    - → Proceed to **Section 2** with real-time (or micro-batch) processing considerations
  - **(B) Daily/Weekly (Batch updates acceptable)**
    - → Proceed to **Section 2** with batch processing in mind

## 2. Data Characteristics & Quality
- **2.1 Volume**
  - **(A) High Volume (tens/hundreds of GB+ per day)**
    - → Consider: Dataflow (batch/streaming), Dataproc (Spark/Hadoop), BigQuery
  - **(B) Low-to-Moderate Volume**
    - → Consider: Cloud Functions, Cloud Run for ETL; Cloud Composer for orchestration
- **2.2 Velocity**
  - **(A) Real-Time (continuous, streaming ingestion)**
    - → *Metric Check:*
      - If throughput (e.g., events/second) is high and transformation complexity is moderate  
        → Use: Pub/Sub + Dataflow (managed streaming, with BigQuery Streaming as needed)
      - Else, if ultra low-latency, stateful, or custom processing is required  
        → Consider: Kubernetes with Kafka (self-managed)
  - **(B) Batch (periodic file-based uploads, CSVs, daily exports)**
    - → *Metric Check:*
      - If daily volume exceeds ~50GB or ETL logic is complex  
        → Use: Dataproc with Apache Spark (or Hadoop) for robust processing
      - Else  
        → Use: Cloud Storage → Dataflow (batch) or Cloud Functions for lightweight jobs
- **2.3 Variety (Data Types)**
  - **(A) Mostly Structured**
    - → Primary store: BigQuery; or Cloud SQL/Spanner if transactional/OLTP is needed
  - **(B) Semi/Unstructured (JSON, logs, images, etc.)**
    - → Use: Cloud Storage for raw data; process via Dataproc (or Bigtable for time-series/lookup)
    - → For log data, a common pattern is: Pub/Sub + Dataflow → BigQuery (storing JSON)

## 3. Technical & Infrastructure Requirements
- **3.1 Existing Environment & Tooling**
  - **(A) All-in on Google Cloud**
    - → Proceed with native integrations
  - **(B) Hybrid/Multicloud (on-prem, other clouds)**
    - → Consider: Transfer Service or Pub/Sub with VPN/Interconnect for ingestion
- **3.2 Orchestration & Scheduling**
  - **(A) Simple Scheduling (e.g., daily jobs)**
    - → Use: Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Run / Cloud Functions
  - **(B) Complex Pipelines (multiple dependencies/DAGs)**
    - → Use: Cloud Composer (managed Apache Airflow)
- **3.3 Performance & Scalability**
  - **(A) High Concurrency / Low-Latency (interactive dashboards)**
    - → Use: BigQuery (optionally with BI Engine) for high-performance analytics  
      → For OLTP-like workloads, consider Cloud SQL, Spanner, or Firestore
  - **(B) Standard Query Performance**
    - → BigQuery is generally the best fit for analytical queries

## 4. Security, Privacy & Compliance
- **4.1 Compliance Requirements**
  - **(A) Strict (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)**
    - → Ensure: Encryption at rest (default in GCP), Cloud KMS for custom key management, and rigorous IAM policies (with potential segregation of PII)
  - **(B) Moderate**
    - → Use: Standard IAM roles and consider VPC Service Controls where applicable
- **4.2 Data Residency Constraints**
  - **(A) Must store in specific regions**
    - → Choose: Region-specific BigQuery datasets, Cloud Storage buckets, etc.
  - **(B) No Special Residency Requirements**
    - → Consider: Multi-region configurations for redundancy and availability

## 5. Operational Considerations & Maintenance
- **5.1 Monitoring & Alerting**
  - **(A) Basic Monitoring**
    - → Use: Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver)
  - **(B) Complex Pipelines**
    - → Use: Integrated monitoring via Cloud Composer logs, Dataflow logs, Cloud Logging, and Cloud Monitoring alerting
- **5.2 Maintenance & Ownership**
  - **(A) Small Team / Limited Ops Resources**
    - → Favor serverless services: Dataflow, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions to minimize operational overhead
  - **(B) Larger Team / DevOps Resources Available**
    - → May opt for managed clusters (e.g., Dataproc, GKE with Kafka) for greater control and customization

## 6. Future-Proofing & Flexibility
- **6.1 Expected Growth in Users & Data Volume**
  - **(A) Exponential Growth**
    - → Design for auto-scaling using: Dataflow, BigQuery, Pub/Sub
  - **(B) Moderate Growth**
    - → A mix of serverless and managed cluster approaches can suffice
- **6.2 Additional Use Cases (e.g., Machine Learning)**
  - **(A) Future ML/Advanced Analytics**
    - → Storing data in BigQuery can simplify ML via BQ ML or exporting to Vertex AI
  - **(B) Other Evolving Requirements**
    - → Maintain a flexible architecture to integrate new GCP services as needed

## 7. Data Storage & Serving
- **7.1 Storage Strategy**
  - **(A) Data Warehouse / Analytical Store**
    - → Use: BigQuery for scalable, partitioned, and replicated data storage; ensure data versioning & access controls are in place.
  - **(B) Operational/Transactional Store**
    - → Use: Cloud SQL, Spanner, or Firestore for low-latency, sharded, and vertically scalable data; consider built-in replication, versioning, and automated backups.
- **7.2 Partitioning & Sharding**
  - **(A) Partitioning**
    - → For time-series or large datasets, apply partitioning in BigQuery/Cloud SQL to optimize query performance.
  - **(B) Sharding**
    - → When a single instance reaches its limits, use sharding (logical or physical) in Cloud Spanner or Firestore.
- **7.3 Replication & Versioning**
  - **(A) Replication**
    - → Use multi-region replication in BigQuery/Cloud Storage for high availability.
  - **(B) Versioning**
    - → Enable object versioning in Cloud Storage or dataset versioning in BigQuery for data lineage and rollback.
- **7.4 Data Serving & Querying**
  - **(A) Analytical Serving**
    - → Use: BigQuery for ad-hoc querying and serving analytics dashboards.
  - **(B) Operational Serving**
    - → Use: Managed OLTP databases (Cloud SQL, Spanner, Firestore) combined with caching (e.g., Memorystore) for low-latency API responses.
